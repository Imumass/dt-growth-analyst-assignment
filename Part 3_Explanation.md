Dashboard Design – Explanation

This dashboard was created to help B2B consulting teams track the effectiveness of outbound campaigns at each stage of the funnel, aligned with the AIDCA framework.

Sheet Structure

1. Funnel Metrics
Tracks performance across four funnel stages — Leads, MQLs, SQLs, and Clients — for each campaign. This helps diagnose drop-off points and conversion bottlenecks with clear percentage values.

2. AIDCA Diagnostics
Each campaign is evaluated at all five stages of the AIDCA model:
- Attention: Are subject lines or hooks grabbing attention?
- Interest: Are pain points being addressed?
- Desire: Are solutions framed as beneficial?
- Conviction: Is trust being built via authority or proof?
- Action: Are CTAs effective?

Stages are color-coded or rated to reveal weak links in messaging.

3. Strategic Recommendations
Based on funnel performance and AIDCA diagnostics, recommendations are proposed for each campaign:
- What to change (e.g., Add case study, simplify tone)
- Which AIDCA stage to target
- Who owns the fix and the timeline

Outcome
The dashboard enables leadership to:
- Quickly locate friction points in the customer journey
- Make focused, data-informed interventions
- Convert analysis into actions that drive growth

It turns scattered campaign data into structured signals for decision-making.
