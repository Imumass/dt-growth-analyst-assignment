Row 1 Fix – Pharma Email (Low SQL)

New Prompt:

“Write an email for the COO of a pharma SME, highlighting how our CRM automation helped a similar company cut compliance errors by 30%.
Structure it using AIDCA and end with a data-driven reason to book a short call.
Inject Authority (pharma-specific success) and Social Proof (existing client results).
Avoid: vague tech talk and generic automation claims.”

Justification:
Targets the Conviction stage with clear ROI. Fixes trust drop at SQL level by using specific case studies and measurable impact.

Row 2 Fix – D2C LinkedIn Message (Weak CTA)

New Prompt:

“Craft a short LinkedIn message for a D2C CTO overwhelmed by scattered data.
Use AIDCA: grab attention with a relatable pain point, build desire with a one-line benefit, and end with a clear CTA: ‘Want a sneak peek of what we built for [D2C brand]?’
Apply Scarcity (beta access) + Reciprocity (offering insights).
Avoid: vague asks like ‘let me know your thoughts.’”

Justification:
Targets Action stage. Solves CTA confusion by prompting a low-friction response and appealing to curiosity.

Row 3 Fix – Construction Email (Too Technical)

New Prompt:

“Write an email for a mid-sized construction firm’s COO.
Keep it jargon-free. Use simple, clear language to show how we helped improve lead-to-site conversions using visual dashboards.
Use AIDCA: spark interest with an industry stat, then show ease-of-use.
Inject Liking (relatable tone) and Authority (regional case).
Avoid: long lists of technical features.”

Justification:
Fixes Interest & Desire drop by simplifying language and improving message–audience resonance.
